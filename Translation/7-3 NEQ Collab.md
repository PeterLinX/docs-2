## NEOqs Collaboration Project Launch


NEO is a global blockchain platform that is taking the charge in developing a smart economy for the future. As we continue to develop our ecosystem, the impending advancement of quantum computing poses a threat to the security of our cryptography. Our protective systems are currently using Elliptic-Curve Cryptography and RSA as our frontline, which can be easily and quickly dispatched by a formidable quantum computing assault. Although these malicious attacks couldnâ€™t be launched in the near future, we still quite certainly consider them as an issue to our system. Thus we have started the initiative known as NEOqs (Quantum Safe) to prevent and prepare, rather than combat the issue when it arrives. At the moment NEOqs is a lattice-based cryptographic mechanism, but it is far from the final initiative that has been proposed. 

Since functional quantum computers are still extremely rare, it allows us to finish the core features for NEOqs and form a robust line of defense. We understand that there are many existing forefronts of research in quantum technology; therefore instead of seeing them as antagonists, we are opening out doors for potential cooperation.

The NEOqs protocol is a crucial part of the development of the NEO Blockchain as it will protect the platform from quantum threats. By launching the NEOqs Collaboration Project, we would like to connect with leading scientists and engineers in order to work together on finding solutions to quantum computing resistance.

Listed below are several potential topics of interest. *Please note that our attention and collaboration will not be limited to these.*

- Fault-tolerant quantum computation
- Quantum programming languages and compilers
- Quantum computer simulator
